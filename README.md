### User stories

A user can currently:

- See a collection of items for sale
- Learn more about the maker
- Find the social media links
- See an item's detail page
- Add the item to cart and see this change reflected in the cart icon
- View their shopping cart with item totals and a total cost

Soon a user will be able to:

- Checkout from the cart page using PayPal (sandbox)
- Filter products by item type or metal
